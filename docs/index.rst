REST API Reference
*******************
The REST API is documented with Postman.  You can access it here:
`<https://apiref.sportstalk247.com/>`_


Client SDKs
*****************
We provide SDKs for the following languages

* `Javascript/Node.js (with Typescript Support) <https://readthedocs.org/projects/sportstalk-sdk-javascript/>`_
* `Swift (iOS) <https://sportstalk-ios-sdk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_
* `Kotlin (Android) <https://sdk-android-kotlin.readthedocs.io/>`_

The client SDKs are wrappers around the REST API and provide convenience functionality to make development easier.  It is always possible to drop back into the REST API directly if you need special functionality.

The iOS and Android SDKs currently contain only chat functionality.  The Javascript SDK has clients for chat and comments.
In all platforms it's possible to use the REST API directly.
